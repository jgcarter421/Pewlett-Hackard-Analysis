# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Overview
While helping a co-worker Bobby, his manager requested to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and to identify employees who are eligible for a mentorship program through the company.  Pwelett Hackard is preparing for the "silver tsunami," and wants to train future leaders of the company prior to the current leadership retiring.  To do this, I utilized SQL to explore the company's databases and determine who will be retiring and their positions within the conmpany.

## Results
### Current Employees
There are currently 240,124 employees working at Pewlett-Hackard, with the breakdown of employees, by department, listed below:

## Summary
In an effort to protect the company against the "Silver Tsunami," Pewlett Hackard will need to begin hiring new employees as soon as possible.  
1. Pewlett Hackard will need to hire 90,398 employees once the retirement-eligible employees begin to retire and leave the company.
  To show how many roles each department will need to hire, I made a separate table showing each role by department with retirement-eligible employees.

2. Only 2% of the retiring employees are eligible for the mentorship program.  That is 1 mentor to 50 employees for positions that would need to be filled.  Absent extraordinary circumstances, there are not enough mentors to train the future generation of the company.

In order to assist the company with mentoring future leaders, I created a table showing how many current employees in leaderhip roles that were eligible for retirement.
